## Testing of the car

The car will be inspected from 3 main perspective during the weekends, trying to identify as many deviation as possible:
- Test drive
- Engine bay
- Interior and exterior

Unfortunately because of the lack of tools i cannot view the car from the bottom.

The fixes will be applied after the full inspection, however possible fix's are provided.

### Preparation

We need something to test against. The owners manual would be the best however the one i got hands on is Dutch and I am so not want to translate continuously. So i did some search on the Internet, but actually i could not find the same owners manual in english, heck in any other language.

First im just gonna test the feature without guide based on common sense, and in the meantime I will try to find and english owners manual, or translate the Dutch one.
